FILES
	- selfie.jpg, serialnumber.jpg
		- These images were to fulfill the first deliverable. My camera is
		terrible at focusing so I couldn't get it to make the serial number,
		so I just added a separate image for that.

	- ifconfig.PNG
		- From USB terminal session

	- winSCP.PNG, winSCP_upload.PNG, winSCP_success.PNG
		- The tutorial you linked for scp(1) was only for linux, so I found
		an alternative for my Windows laptop:
			- I installed an SSH server (freeSSHd) on my laptop, but when I
			tried to scp from the Edison, the server on my laptop wouldn't
			accept my password.
			- A quick look online suggested that the more popular method for 
			Windows users is to install winSCP, which has a GUI interface
			because nobody will ever convince Windows users to use the
			terminal. The three screengrabs I included are the winSCP interface.

	- helloworld.PNG, helloworld.c
		- helloworld.PNG is the screengrab of the compilation and execution.
		- helloworld.c is included because it still has Windows line endings
		to prove that it came from my laptop

	- git.PNG, screen.PNG
		- git.PNG: git was already installed, so I just pulled a repo.
		- screen.PNG: Since git was already installed, I used opkg to install
		screen, which is another program I use a lot.


NOTES
Before I did this assignment, I had already done some setup on my
Edison to set up my environment with my personal .bashrc and .vimrc,
which is why my prompt isn't the default.
